// executeCommand on Windows contains some dark sorcery. On Windows, the `rusage` equivalent does not include
// memory information. In order to get this info, we need the process `handle`, not just its PID. Process
// handle can be obtained by using `OpenProcess` syscall, but that is a data race, as the process might have
// already exited by the time our syscall returns. To do this, we rely on the fact that the stdlib does not
// change the process handle until a successful `Wait`. And on Windows, as long as we hold the handle, we
// have access to the process information. So we'll use reflection to get the value of the handle and do a
// `DuplicateHandleâ€œ syscall. With this duplicated handle, we'll be able to access all the info we need.
// Additionally, the `DuplicateHandle` syscall will fail if we do anything wrong, so it will also act as a
// validation layer.
