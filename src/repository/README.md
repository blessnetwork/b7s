## repository

The JSONRepository module is a Go module that provides functionality for interacting with a JSON-based function repository. It includes a struct called JSONRepository that has a method called "Get()" which takes in a context and a manifest path. The Get method retrieves the function manifest from the repository by making a GET request to the provided manifest path, it then verifies if the runtime url is present in the manifest, if not it populates the deployment url and gets the ID from the hostname. It then checks if the function is present in cache, if not it downloads the function and caches it, if present it skips the download process and returns the function manifest. It also includes a function called UnGzip which extracts a gzipped archive to a specified destination.
